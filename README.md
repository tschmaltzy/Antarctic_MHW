# Antarctic_MHW
My Honours project analysis for MHWs in the seasonally sea-ice-covered regions of the Southern Ocean.

My code is organised as follows – I have provided all code to remake the figures in the Figure Code file. I have provided the only data less than 100 MB on here. There are very large datasets (TB, 10's of GBs) on the NCI servers. You can find these on NCI under /scratch/e14/ts7341 or /g/data/e14/ts7341/Figure_Code_For_Manuscript/Science. These can be made available upon request. Upon publication, these will be made available on a Zenodo. To conduct the data processing, 'Process Datasets' has most of the relevant code. As of now, the hat averaging scheme cannot be placed on here, as it is awaiting submission to a journal.


All notebooks have the correct pathways, such that you could download the notebook, open it on the NCI servers and run the code. You need to be a member of e14, ik11, and xp65 on these servers. The relevant environment used was: /g/data/xp65/public/modules/conda/analysis3-24.12. 


If there are any issues, please reach out! I can share these files through larger file sharing servers (such as OneDrive or Google Drive!).
